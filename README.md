# Alarm-Security-System
Collaborated with a team of four members to plan and implement an alarm  system in a room, using an ATmega328p. The alarm allows the user to choose  from two modes, stay and away. In away mode, it makes use of a PIR sensor  module, an analog light sensor and a microphone detect movement inside the  room.
